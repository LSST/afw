        Approximate a bounded field as a ChebyshevBoundedField.

        Parameters
        ----------
        boundedField : `lsst.afw.math.BoundedField`
            A bounded field to approximate
        orderX : `int`, optional
            Order of the Chebyshev polynomial in the x direction.
            Default is 3.
        orderY : `int`, optional
            Order of the Chebyshev polynomial in the y direction.
            Default is 3.
        nStepX : `int`, optional
            Number of x steps to approximate boundedField.
            Default is 100.
        nStepY : `int`, optional
            Number of y steps to approximate boundedField.
            Default is 100.
