/**
 *  @brief Combination of a TAN WCS and a distortion model
 *
 * This object represents a common case for raw or minimally processed data; we have estimates for:
 * - a pure TAN WCS based on telescope pointing
 * - a distortion model which converts between PIXELS and TAN_PIXELS coordinates, based on an optical model
 * This object combines the two in a way that makes it easy to estimate sky<->pixel coordinates.
 *
 * @warning This is not a full-fledged WCS class in several respects:
 * - It has no standard FITS WCS representation.
 * - It does not support persistence or unpersistence from FITS. The usual use case is to represent the WCS
 *   for an exposure that has a plain TAN WCS and a distortion model in its detector;
 *   As such, the data is present in two disparate places, making persistence difficult.
 * - It cannot be flipped or rotated. This is probably fixable, but does not seem worth the work.
