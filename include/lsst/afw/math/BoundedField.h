/**
 *  @brief An abstract base class for 2-d functions defined on an integer bounding boxes
 *
 *  Integer bounding boxes (afw.geom.Box2I) are inclusive of the end pixels (integer positions correspond
 *  to the centers of the pixels and include the entirety of those pixels). Thus a BoundedField defined on
 *  the box [x0, x1] x [y0, y1] actually covers the range [x0 - 0.5, x1 + 0.5] x [y0 - 0.5, y1 + 0.5].
 *
 *  BoundedField provides a number of ways of accessing the function, all delegating to a single
 *  evaluate-at-a-point implementation.  The base class does not mandate anything about how the field
 *  is constructed, so it's appropriate for use with e.g. model-fitting results, interpolation results
 *  points, or functions known a priori.
 *
 *  Usually, BoundedField will be used to represent functions that correspond to images, for quantities
 *  such as aperture corrections, photometric scaling, PSF model parameters, or backgrounds, and its
 *  bounding box will be set to match the PARENT bounding box of the image.
