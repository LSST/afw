``lsst.afw.math`` provides mathematical functions such as convolution and image statistics.
Key features:

* Function objects `FunctionF` and `FunctionD`
* `Statistics`
* `Background` estimation of images.
* `Interpolate`
* `Kernel`
* Optimization of functions is handled by `minimize()`
* Convolution of images is handled by `convolve()`
* Warping of images is handled by `warpImage()`
* Manipulating spatially-distributed sets of objects (e.g. PSF candidates)
